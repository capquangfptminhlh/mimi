# AGENTS.md — PROJECT BOOTSTRAP

This repository is governed by the central Website OS repository:

- Source repo: `capquangfptminhlh/seo-web`
- Source ref: `main`
- Manifest: `governance/website-os.manifest.yml`
- Central entrypoint: `AGENTS.md`
- Enforcement engine: `engine/website_os_engine.py`
- Engine policy: `engine/policy.yml`
- Full-scope standard: `standards/Website_OS_Full_Scope_Launch_Completeness_Gate_v1.0.0.md`
- Full-scope machine policy: `governance/full-scope-launch-policy.yml`

## Mandatory startup

Before planning, coding, designing, writing content, running SEO, changing production configuration, reviewing, or modifying this project:

1. Load `capquangfptminhlh/seo-web` at the declared source ref.
2. Read `governance/website-os.manifest.yml`.
3. Resolve and record the central source commit SHA.
4. Follow the manifest `mandatory_read_order` completely.
5. Read all relevant central QA/evidence/normative files referenced by that stack.
6. Only then read and apply this project's local rules below.
7. Complete K0 Keyword Intelligence plus the full keyword/page/image launch plan before production code.
8. When runtime/CI access is available, run the central Website OS Enforcement Engine against this project before claiming a gate PASS.
9. At release, run the full-scope launch verifier before claiming the website is complete.

If the central repo, manifest, enforcement engine, engine policy, or any mandatory normative file cannot be resolved, return:

`HOLD — WEBSITE OS BOOTSTRAP MISSING OR STALE`

Do not proceed from memory or an old summary.

## Executable enforcement

Default engine command after the central repo has been resolved:

`python <central-seo-web>/engine/website_os_engine.py --project-root . --governance-root <central-seo-web> --evidence-dir .website-os/evidence --gate auto --out-dir .website-os/out`

Release verifier:

`python <central-seo-web>/scripts/verify-full-scope-launch.py --project-root . --evidence-dir .website-os/evidence`

A hard engine/verifier FAIL is blocking. Do not hide/delete findings to obtain PASS.

Permitted waivers must be explicit, expiring, attributable and backed by a Decision Record. Waived findings remain visible in the machine report.

## Full-scope build contract

Production implementation is blocked until the evidence set contains a PASS full-scope launch plan with:
- complete retained keyword mapping;
- canonical URL/page inventory;
- keyword-to-page coverage;
- complete image production plan;
- explicit launch/HOLD/post-launch decisions.

A homepage/sample/vertical slice may be used during development, but MUST NOT be handed off as the completed website.

Final release requires planned-vs-implemented verification for every `BUILD_LAUNCH` page and required image, including mobile, technical SEO, visual fidelity, link integrity and placeholder checks.

When the project requires all-new imagery, the production image set must be new for the project except documented approved reuse.

Allowed completion wording:

`100% launch-complete for the approved scope as of <observed_at>.`

This is not a guarantee of search ranking and does not mean future maintenance will never be needed.

Default post-launch editorial target may be up to 3 qualified articles/day, but publish fewer when evidence/quality/cannibalization gates do not pass.

## Rule precedence

Local project rules may extend or strengthen central Website OS rules, but MUST NOT silently weaken central hard gates. Any permitted deviation requires a Decision Record with provenance.

## Bootstrap evidence

Before substantive work, record:
- source repo;
- source ref;
- resolved source commit SHA;
- manifest version;
- `observed_at`;
- mandatory read completion;
- Bootstrap PASS/HOLD;
- enforcement engine version when executed;
- policy/evidence fingerprints when produced;
- unresolved/waived findings.

Before final handoff, also record:
- retained keyword universe count;
- P0/P1 cluster count;
- planned vs implemented launch pages;
- planned vs implemented images;
- missing/broken/placeholder counts;
- mobile/SEO verification coverage;
- launch-completeness PASS/HOLD;
- post-launch editorial cadence.

## Project-specific rules — Lumi Pet Shop full replacement

- Project repo: `capquangfptminhlh/mimi`.
- Current task is a 100% replacement of the previous website, not a visual refresh or incremental patch.
- Previous production/UI files may be used only as factual seed/reference; they are NOT a visual or structural source of truth.
- Google Business Profile/Maps and first-party Lumi sources take precedence for current business facts when verified.
- Do not fabricate prices, promotions, opening hours, review counts, service availability, medical/veterinary claims, or 24/7 claims.
- Unverified commercial facts must be `UNKNOWN`, `UNVERIFIED`, or `HOLD` until verified.
- Local SEO is in scope. Location-name substitution pages are prohibited unless real local value exists.
- All production imagery for the replacement website must be new for this project unless a Decision Record permits otherwise.
- The previous single-page topology must not constrain the new information architecture.
- Booking UX should remain possible, but confirmation language must clearly distinguish a booking request from a confirmed appointment unless a real-time booking source is integrated.
- Mobile is a first-class composition and must be verified independently.
